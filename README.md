# My Code:You Capstone Project Plan

Hi! I'm Kevin and I'm studying C# with Code:You Kentucky. This repo is for documenting my plan and ideas for my final capstone project. Please feel free to make suggestions or just share your thoughts. Anything helps!


# Overview and Background

My wife and I like to collect and read books. We especially like to find books at thrift stores (it feels like a treasure hunt). My project aims to create an easy to use application for keeping track of the books we have in our collection. It's essentially a purpose-built inventory control app. 

## What features would I like to implement?

- A visually appealing layout and design
- Simple and easy-to-understand GUI
- The ability to add books and information about them to a database
	>Title, Author, Description, ISBN (if available), if we have read the book or not
- The ability to delete books from the database
- The ability to search the database and find if a book is in the collection or not
- Implement an API to fetch additional book information from the web (if available)
	>Cover art, detailed description

## How will these features be implemented?

- Using Avalonia to create the front end
- Using Avalonia for interactive buttons, text input, and window transitions
- Using SQLite for storing book information
- Using ...? API for fetching additional information from the web
	>Google Books API or OpenLibrary API

## What's the name of this application?

I've landed on **Goweli** (go-way-lee) which is the English spelling of the Cherokee word for "book."

## Logo

I'm not a graphic designer. I've never been able to get a grasp on image creation or editing tools.
In this case, I used AI to generate an image with a shape that I liked. I then used Inkscape to do a bitmap trace to give me a simple logo and saved it as a PNG.

## What will the app look like?

Not only am I not a graphic designer, I'm not a UX designer either. I threw this together in Microsoft Designer. I like the chosen color pallet and I hope the layout is user-friendly and easy to understand. It will likely end up be much simpler than this because I do not know how far my skills will develop before the project is due. The below image will likely change a few more times as I develop my ideas. I'm already thinking of changing the layout of the windows to a stacked implementation
